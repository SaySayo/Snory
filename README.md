# 💡 Inspiration 💡
Chilly winter days give us an excuse to curl up in our blankets with a hot mug of coffee. According to studies, productivity drops dramatically during the winter months. Students frequently experience difficulties with concentration. Could there be a tool that can assist us to focus when we're distracted and wake us up when we're tired?

This prompted us to create Snory, an AI-powered application that tracks facial expressions and gives statistics to help focus better.

## ❓ What it does ❓
Snory can be your study-mate or your productivity partner.

Sign in to your account.
Set the time for which you want to focus on a task.
Open a PDF, play a video or simply run a link to your work.
Let Snory run in the background.
After your specified focus period, Snory will provide you with a detailed analysis of your emotions with the help of charts and graphs. It helps you figure out the time duration when you were unfocused. If you get drowsy or quit working during your chosen time, Snory sends you an alert. A session can be started/stopped, restarted, and a CSV file of the results can be downloaded.

Essentially, Snory helps one work better and more efficiently.

## ⚙️ How we built it ⚙️
We built the frontend using HTML, CSS and React. Firstly, we used Figma to design the outlook of the project. Then we took a part of it each and collaborated on Github to create our website. The backend is a machine learning model built using React, JS and TensorFlow. Once the backend and frontend were created, we integrated them. We got our domain "dont-snore-with.us" from GoDaddy and hosted it using GitHub pages.

## 🚧 Challenges we ran into 🚧
On the frontend side of things, it was a challenge to coordinate work on the website because we wanted our website to look cohesive and concise. To keep our style consistent, we made mocks up of our website using Figma so that all of us were on the same page. We faced conflicts while merging the login page branch and had to resolve them together.

## ✨Accomplishments that we're proud of ✨
Primarily, we are proud of our project idea. The concept behind the creation of Snory is unique and valid. This tool can prove helpful to people from various domains. We are proud that we could successfully build Snory with all the necessary functions. The integration of AI with the frontend posed a challenge but we successfully overcame it.

## 👩🏻‍💻 What we learned 👩🏻‍💻
Our project allowed us to get out of our comfort zones and try something new. We spent quite a lot of time brainstorming the idea and deciding our tech stack. The team members learnt about various technology from each other while collaborating on the project. The ML-AI part was new for most of us. We learnt about resolving conflicts while merging pull requests on GitHub.

## 💭 What's next for Snory 💭
The project was built to be a real app and have a positive impact on students and learning techniques. We would love to make the website more scalable and cross-platform so that the user interaction increases. We plan on including the following advanced features in Snory:

History tab to help a user know and understand their attention span.
Alert feature when the task is abruptly quit.
As the same says, Snory reduces your snores during the season of snow.
